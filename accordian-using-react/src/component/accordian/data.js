    "question": "When should I use an accordion?",
    "answer": "Accordions are best used when you have a lot of content but limited space. They help reduce scrolling and allow users to jump directly to the information they find most relevant."

    "id": 3,
    "question": "Are accordions good for SEO?",
    "answer": "Yes, as long as the content is present in the HTML DOM. Search engines can crawl hidden content within accordions, though it's important to ensure the code is accessible and semantic."

    "question": "Can I have multiple panels open at once?",
    "answer": "This depends on the implementation. Some accordions are 'exclusive' (only one open at a time), while others allow multiple sections to be toggled independently."

    "question": "Is this component mobile-friendly?",
